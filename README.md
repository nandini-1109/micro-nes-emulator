# Micro NES Emulator (In Progress)

A minimal Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) emulator built from scratch to understand
low-level systems concepts such as CPU emulation, memory mapping, and instruction execution.

This project focuses on **core correctness and system design**, not full game compatibility.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Emulate core components of the NES
- Understand CPU instruction cycles and memory access
- Build a clean, testable emulator architecture

---

## 🧠 What’s Implemented / Planned
- [ ] 6502 CPU instruction set (partial)
- [ ] Memory map (RAM, ROM, I/O)
- [ ] ROM loading (iNES format)
- [ ] Basic rendering (SDL2)
- [ ] Step-by-step CPU execution

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** C++
- **Graphics:** SDL2
- **Concepts:** CPU emulation, memory management, bitwise operations
